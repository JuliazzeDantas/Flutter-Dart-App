# PRIMEIRO_PROGRAMA

This is my first project in Flutter and Dart! The purpose of this project is to demonstrate my initial skills in Flutter and Dart by creating a simple app that performs mathematical operations. In this project, I don't use any keyboard input, and the mathematical operations are fixed and pre-defined.

## Features

The app can perform the following mathematical operations:

- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division

The operations are performed with two pre-defined fixed numbers. The result of the operation is displayed on the screen.
